# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains three diverse projects, each addressing unique challenges and applications within the realm of machine learning.

## Project 1: 3D User Interface

### Overview

This project aims to address the limitations of current 3D user interfaces, particularly those relying on remote controls, which often exhibit discrepancies between user movement and on-screen representation. The goal is to create a 3D user interface that offers unrestricted movement for a more intuitive and immersive experience.

### Key Features

- **Simultaneous Hand Movement and Pose Estimation:** The project incorporates advanced machine learning techniques to estimate both hand movement and hand pose simultaneously. This enables precise and dynamic interactions within the 3D environment.

- **Ring-Shaped Camera Implementation:** To eliminate movement restrictions, a unique approach has been adopted by implementing a ring-shaped camera directly on the user's hand. This design choice ensures that the camera moves seamlessly with the user, providing an accurate representation of real-world movement.

- **Image Estimation Challenges:** Due to the ring-shaped camera, capturing an image of the entire hand appearance becomes challenging. However, leveraging machine learning, the project successfully overcomes this limitation by employing techniques to estimate the hand's appearance.
